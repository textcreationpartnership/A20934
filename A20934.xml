            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11457:13"/> mother of devotion. In the matter of Gods ≈øervice, men admire mo≈øt, what they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand lea≈øt; and ob≈øcuritie augments reverence, and herewith fareth it as with beauties; the which when men doe nothing but ≈øtand at enterview and at gaze, they kindle and inflame the more concupi≈øcence.</p>
               <p>Negligence and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe contribute to this evill; For men having no naturall inclination to bee in≈øtructed in the knowledge of God, they uoluntarily disburden them≈øelves of that care upon them that make profe≈ø≈øion to in≈øtruct them; rather then they will take the paines to learne, they had rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve without knowing, and follow others without any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11457:13"/> further inqui≈øition to informe them≈øelves; and this affected ignorance cloketh it ≈øelfe with the ≈øpecious title of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect towards the Church, and of quickne≈ø≈øe of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion; if there be que≈øtion of putting forth a mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, there men will be ≈øure to enquire out the be≈øt ≈øecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and men are in this point full of diffidence and di≈øtru≈øt: but when the point of ≈øalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion falleth into debate, they referre them≈øelves to rely on the faith of another, and blindfold their owne eyes with a uoluntarie ignorance.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11457:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> familiar communication with God. And by the ≈øelfe ≈øame meanes, they them≈øelves take ≈øanctuary, and hinder, that there can no cleare in≈øpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be made into their affaires; and gaine the liberty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate religion to their owne profit, and to carve and ≈øhred it at their plea≈øure. Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as theeves do, that blowe out the candells for feare of being di≈øcride; for they are afraid, lea≈øt the things which men admire a farre off, being knowne and better taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of at a nearer di≈øtance, ≈øhould become contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vtterly out of reque≈øt: Like unto painted women, who would not willingly bee uiewed neere at hand; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving learned by experience, that there is trouble to lead
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11457:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ignorant; and that it is ea≈øie≈øt diving into a blinde mans pur≈øe, and that every man that would be informed in the rea≈øon and originall of things is not ea≈øily per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Hence commeth it that they withdraw the people from reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that they hinder the tran≈ølating of them into the vulgar tongue. Hence commeth it, that they labour ≈øo much to ca≈øt an a≈øper≈øion upon the Scriptures, and to make them to be ≈øu≈øpected by the people, as a dangerous booke; and that the reading thereof is the cau≈øe of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies. Hence came in Images, which ≈øerve to amaze, and to holde at gaze the eyes whil≈øt they blinde their under≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11457:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> and to afford them recreation, whil≈øt they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and bereave the of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction Hence came that heape of Ceremonies, which are ≈øhaddowes, which growe apace, and ≈øtretch out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves in length, when the night of ignorance is neere at hand. Hence came that implicit faith, which relyeth on the faith of another, and which beleeveth that which the Church of his countrey beleeveth, without ever knowing that which the Church ought to beleeve: and which ≈øerveth God by cu≈øtome, following the thronge, and involveing them≈øelves in the multitude. Hence came in the Liturgie in a ≈øtrange tongue, and not under≈øtood; as if the engli≈øh
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11457:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> tongue were too ba≈øe and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall for divine ≈øervice. Hence came in the cu≈øtome of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God without knowing what they asked of him; as if they were affraid to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand them≈øelves. Hence came it to pa≈ø≈øe, that as in the publique reading of the Scriptures; God is a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian unto men, ≈øo al≈øo in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique prayers the Prie≈øt is a barbarian to the A≈ø≈øembly, and in the prayers of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, every one is a barbarian to him≈øelfe.</p>
               <p>The occa≈øions and the change of affaires, have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto often contributed: For the vulgar tongue of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey comming to be abba≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øed by laps of time, or being ≈øuddenly changed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd medley, the blending,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11457:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> and invndation and uiolent breaking in of ≈øtrange peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Pa≈øtors and leaders of the people have not beene carefull to accommodate the publique ≈øervice unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding of the new inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and to the tongue in v≈øe: So that the Liturgie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in le≈ø≈øe then fiftie yeares, not to be under≈øtood by the people And this came to pa≈ø≈øe in <hi>Italie,</hi> where the Latine was the vulgar in the time of the Apo≈øtles, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages after: But the Latine being corrupted by the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>Goths, Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and by the extingui≈øhing &amp; aboli≈øhing of good letters and learning; the Bi≈øhops ≈øtill retained the ≈øervice in the ancient tongue, and ≈øuffered the people to

               <p>True religion taketh a quite contrary way. It re≈øi≈øts this naturall inclination of men, by which they flie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction, fearing to learne the will of God, lea≈øt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ≈øhould oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to follow it: thorow the brightne≈ø≈øe of the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it di≈ø≈øipates the kingdome of the Prince of darkne≈ø≈øe: For the people ought to bee clearely in≈øtructed in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ≈øaluation; ≈øeeing they have as great a ≈øhare in ≈øalvation as the Pa≈øtors.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11457:25"/> to apply his prayer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly unto his nece≈ø≈øitie; this cannot be done by him that prayeth without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding him≈øelfe, and who by cu≈øtome ≈øayeth a prayer in terms not under≈øtood: very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it falleth out, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which hath an intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to aske of God ≈øomething, ≈øaith in his Latine prayers things farre from his owne inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Thus Courtizans and women, that under≈øtand the Latine iu≈øt as much as the Greeke, doe ≈øay in Latine their ≈øeaven P≈øalmes;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 143.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>David</hi> being ≈øicke, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth that hee halteth as he goeth, and that his raines were enflamed, and ≈øpeaketh as one ≈øhut up in a darke Cave, whither <hi>Saul</hi> had brought him: is it credible,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11457:25"/> that a ≈øilly woman pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the≈øe things in Latine, once thinkes of asking ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or the forgivene≈ø≈øe of ≈øinnes?</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Apo≈øtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in his 1. Chap. wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, that when we aske any thing of God, <hi>wee aske it in faith, not doubting at all.</hi> Now it is impo≈ø≈øible to aske of God any thing in faith and in full a≈ø≈øurance, when the thing is not knowne which is asked of God, for faith implyeth and bringeth knowledge. Wherevpon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo our Saviour Ie≈øus Chri≈øt conioyneth ordinarily know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with faith, as in the 10 of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> ver. 38. <hi>That you may know and beleeve that the Father is in me:</hi> and in the 17.

Chap. ver. 11. ≈øaith, that wee are iu≈øtified by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="3">III. One cannot accu≈øe a man in plainer tearmes to bee out of his wits, then in ≈øaying to him; <hi>You know not what you ≈øay.</hi> But all things which in civill conver≈øation would bee e≈øteemed ab≈øurd, in the Romi≈øh religion are held for good: as if reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ≈øerved to trouble the wits, or were a receptacle of ab≈øurdities; and that which otherwaies is a folly, here is a devotion. God then ≈øhall deale iu≈øtly to grant nothing to that per≈øon, that knowes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:11457:26"/> not what he askes; and by con≈øequent knoweth this, that God hath denied him.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Here experience and nece≈ø≈øitie reforme men by force; for they who ≈øhall have all their life long, made their prayers in latine without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding of them≈øelves, in ≈øuddaine afflictions and in great griefes will change their language, and will ca≈øt forth unto God their fervent prayers in their ordinarie tongue. A man which is in the pangues of death, or that is upon the Iibbet (unle≈ø≈øe he bee utterly bruti≈øh) will never ≈øay <hi>Beati quorum,</hi> nor the <hi>Pater</hi> in Latine.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But what good grace can a Latine prayer have, which a poore ≈øilly woman ≈øaith to S. <hi>Mary</hi> the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:11457:27"/> or to S. Magdaleine who never under≈øtood the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine? And albeit that indeed they had learned their Latine in Paradi≈øe, yet ≈øo it is, that all that is nothing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the voice without knowing the heart: it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that he on whom wee mu≈øt call, doe know the faith and the repentance of him, that prayeth lea≈øt he heare an hypocrite. Now the Word of God teacheth us, that God alone knoweth the hearts of men, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. ver. 30.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Above all to be pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the Latine prayer of a woman, or of an Artizan, which prayeth to S. <hi>Vr≈øula,</hi> or to S. <hi>Margarite,</hi> or to S. <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> or to S. <hi>Chry≈øtopher,</hi> or to S. <hi>Martial,</hi> or to S. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>gius,</hi> or to S. <hi>Lazarus</hi> patron of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,

               <p n="7">VII. That if unto a man that prayeth in Latine, not under≈øtanding that which he ≈øaith, any one had given one of <hi>E≈øops</hi> fables in Latine, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwading him, that it is a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> ≈øuch a man, according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> pronouncing this fable
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:11457:28"/> with fervent affection, ≈øhould not cea≈øe to pray in faith, and ≈øhould not loo≈øe the merit of his prayer.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That if a French man not under≈øtanding the Germane tongue, ≈øhould come and aske ≈øomething of the King in the high Dutch, the King although he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood the high Dutch, would take this di≈øcour≈øe for a mockerie, or would thinke ≈øuch a man to be be≈øide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. In this point the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt ought to ≈øerve us for a rule, who pre≈øcribing a forme of prayer unto his Di≈øciples, gave them one in their u≈øuall and ordinarie tongue, ≈øaying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>When you pray, ≈øay our Father which art in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11457:28"/> &amp;c.</hi> He gave them not this prayer in the <hi>By≈øcane,</hi> nor in the <hi>Arabian.</hi> For he would have them when they prayed, know what they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of God; and what were the things whereof they ≈øtood in need.</p>
               <p n="10">X. And with ≈øuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent art is this prayer framed and compo≈øed; that the faithfull ≈øpeaking unto God, ≈øpeaketh al≈øo unto him≈øelfe, and that every petition is a commandement; for as the commandements of God are the matter of our prayers, and teach us that which wee ought to aske of God; ≈øo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo the petitions which God hath pre≈øcribed us containe the commandements. In asking of God that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may come, we oblige
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:11457:29"/> and binde over our ≈øelves to labour for the advancement of this kingdome. In asking and praying that the name of God may be hallowed, wee are adverti≈øed to hallowe it our ≈øelves; and we are taught by this prayer, not to covet another mans bread, and to forgive them that have tre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øed again≈øt us, and to e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew the temptations of evill; le≈ø≈øons which cannot be compri≈øed by him, that under≈øtands not him≈øelfe, and prayeth in a tongue which hee under≈øtands not.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. True it is that God under≈øtands all tongues; but withall, his plea≈øure is, that he that ≈øpeaketh unto him, know what he ≈øaith, and that he ≈øpeake as a man, and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable creature, that is to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11457:29"/> ≈øay, with rea≈øon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding. God indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtands thy tongue; but withall, he under≈øtands that thou under≈øtands not thy ≈øelfe; it is a grand abu≈øe to thinke that wee ≈øpeake unto God, to the end hee might under≈øtand our language; for before wee opened our mouthes hee knew our thoughts; and it is bee that puts prayer into the heart of them that feare him: now it is the heart that mu≈øt move the lips, and ≈øugge≈øt to the mouth words conformable to the thought.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Thus prayed the Prophets: <hi>David</hi> prayed in his owne tongue, and dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> the P≈øalmes in a tongue they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood: who whil≈øt they

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> That publique ≈øervice in a tongue not understood, is contrary to the Word of God, and to rea≈øon.</head>
               <p n="1">I. ABu≈øe in the Liturgie and publique ≈øervice is yet more pernitious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe God him≈øelfe is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wrapped up, and made a barbarian unto men, and his word by this meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not intelligible: as if men would fru≈øtrate God of his intention, which is to ≈øpeake unto us to in≈øtruct us; as if Ie≈øus Chri≈øt came downe from heaven of purpo≈øe to ≈øpeake to men without being under≈øtood. For in the Ma≈ø≈øe there are not onely
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11457:37"/> prayers unto God, but al≈øo therein are read places of Scriptures in which God ≈øpeakes unto men. In pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in a tongue not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood, there is u≈øed this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent excu≈øe, that God under≈øtands all tongues, as if we ≈øpake with the mouth; to the end, to be under≈øtood by God: But here where the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe is concerning God ≈øpeaking to men, this excu≈øe hath no place; for when God ≈øpeaketh unto men, hee will bee heard and under≈øtood: and indeed when for excu≈øe it is ≈øaid, that God under≈øtands al tongues, it is pre≈øuppo≈øed that he unto whom he ≈øpeaketh, ≈øhould under≈øtand that which is ≈øaid unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:11457:37"/> teacheth us that when God is provoked to di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure again≈øt his people; hee makes them heavie of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that they may not heare, and that their hearts may not under≈øtand; as God him≈øelfe ≈øpeaketh by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>E≈øay.</hi> Chap. 6. ver≈øe 10.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Be≈øides it is al≈øo one of Gods cur≈øes, wherewith hee puni≈øheth the ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and the contempt of his word, when he ≈øpeakes to a people in a ≈øtrange tongue, that they may not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, as the Apo≈øtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in the fir≈øt to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> Chap. 14. where he bringeth in God ≈øpeaking thus by his Prophet <hi>E≈øay.</hi>

                     <hi>E≈øay</hi> 25.11.</note> 
                  <hi>I will ≈øpeake to this people by men of another tongue,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:11457:38"/> and by ≈øtrange lips, and thus they ≈øhall not understand, ≈øaith the Lord. Wherefore tongues are for a ≈øigne not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beleevers, but vnto infidells.</hi> This threatning is fulfilled in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God puni≈øheth the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of mens hearts by ≈øpeaking unto them in a tongue which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand not.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. In this matter this maxime taken out of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, and from the intention of the creature ought to be laid for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; namely, that the tongue was given unto man to be the interpreter of his thoughts, and me≈ø≈øenger of his conceptions. Whence it followeth that to u≈øe the tongue to a contrarie end,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:11457:38"/> and to ≈øpeake to the end to be not under≈øtood, is to turne nature top≈øie turvie and quite to overthrowe her; and as much as in us lyeth to fru≈øtrate the Creator of his intention: and to change humane ≈øpeech into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Echo, and into a ≈øound beating the aire. Now if this bee true in him which ≈øpeaketh to others in a tongue which he under≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, it is yet more true in him which is under≈øtood neither by him≈øelfe nor by another.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Out of the ≈øelfe ≈øame maxime, it followeth that when the Prie≈øt ≈øpeaketh La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine in the Church, he ought to ≈øpeake to bee under≈øtood by ≈øome body. Our adver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries mu≈øt tell us, whether he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:11457:39"/> ≈øpeake to bee under≈øtood by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtants, or to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood by him≈øelfe, or to bee under≈øtood by God, for there is no fourth. Now hee ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not to be under≈øtood of the by-≈øtanders, ≈øeeing hee ≈øpeaketh ≈øo very lowe, and in a tongue which the people under≈øtand not: and be≈øides, in private Ma≈ø≈øes hee ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth alone and without any a≈ø≈øi≈øtants: Be≈øides he ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not to be under≈øtood of God; for God under≈øtands us without our ≈øpeaking, though we ≈øpeake not at all, and before wee open our mouthes: nor can it rather be ≈øaid, that the Prie≈øt in the Ma≈ø≈øe ≈øpeaketh to the end to be under≈øtood by him≈øelfe, for hee knew his owne thought before hee ≈øpake:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11457:39"/> ≈øpeech was given man not to informe him≈øelfe in his own thoughts, but to the end to make it knowne to another; he is utterly be≈øide him≈øelfe that ≈øpeaketh to him≈øelfe, to the end, to under≈øtand him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Add herevnto, that in many places of the Ma≈ø≈øe, the Prie≈øt ≈øpeaketh to the people, ≈øaying unto them, <hi>Oremus, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Orate pro me fratres, &amp;c.</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øuch like things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Prie≈øt bids the people aske of God ≈øuch and ≈øuch things, and to ioyne their prayers with his: but the people have no minde to obey that his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not ≈øo much as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the Prie≈øt bids them doe; the people might
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:11457:40"/> iu≈øtly ≈øay to him, <hi>make us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand thee, if thou wilt be obeyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. Wherefore in the Church of the Old Te≈øtament, the whole publique ≈øervice was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the vulgar tongue; and the prayers which <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Succe≈ø≈øors made for the Hebrew people were made in the Hebrew tongue: which after the captivitie of <hi>Babylon</hi> being corrupted, yet was ≈øtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood by the people, as wee will ≈øhew hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Our Lord Ie≈øus Chri≈øt in≈øtituted and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the holy Supper among≈øt his Di≈øciples in the vulgar tongue, and that which was under≈øtood by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:11457:40"/> the a≈ø≈øi≈øtants; his will was, that when the faithfull ≈øhall <hi>eat of that bread, and drinke of that cup, they ≈øhew forth the Lords death untill he come againe.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 26.

               <p n="9">IX. To this very ≈øelfe ≈øame end he gave unto his Apo≈øtles the gift of divers tongues, to the end, that in all nations they might e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øh the ≈øervice of God in the tongue of the countrey, and that in every tongue God might be ≈øerved, in ≈øuch ≈øort, that the diver≈øitie of tongues which at the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Babel</hi> was a cur≈øe, at the building of the Church is become a ble≈ø≈øing.</p>

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:11457:41"/>X. The Apo≈øtles followed their Ma≈øters example; for the Apo≈øtle writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that were Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, gave them in their owne tongue the forme of the Celebration of the holy Supper. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Would Ie≈øus Chri≈øt who is the light of the world come to plunge it in darkne≈ø≈øe, and to make things more ob≈øcure? And God having ≈øpoken to his people by <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in a tongue under≈øtood, would hee now wrap and infold up him≈øelfe in darkne≈ø≈øe by propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Word, and by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Sacraments in a barbarous and an unknowne tongue?</p>
               <p n="12">XII. But that which is yet of more ≈øtrength in this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11457:41"/> matter, and which clearely decides, and fully determins this controver≈øie, is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Apo≈øtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who imployed the 14. Chapter of his 1. Epi≈øtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in a manner wholly to condemne the u≈øe of ≈øtrange tongues, and not under≈øtood in the Church. <hi>If</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>the trumpet give an uncertaine ≈øound, who ≈øhall be prepared to the warre?

For the≈øe miraculous gifts of tongues were rare, and given unto ≈øome Chri≈øtians for a ≈ømall time; to the end to declare the power of God, and by con≈øequent the u≈øe of them in the Church brought with them a benefit, which the Ma≈ø≈øe in Latine cannot bring.

               <p>BY what hath beene hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ≈øaid, it appeareth that in this que≈øtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a tongue not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood, which is u≈øed in the publique ≈øervice, we have the Word of God, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and the confe≈ø≈øion of our Adver≈øaries on our ≈øide. Wherevnto we mu≈øt add the example of the ancient Church, as well of the old as of the new Te≈øtament, which ought to ≈øerve us for a rule.</p>
               <p n="1">I. To fetch the matter
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:11457:53"/> from the beginning: God gave his lawe in a tongue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood: and the forme of prayers and ble≈ø≈øings, which God pre≈øcribed to <hi>Aaron</hi> to make before the people, was in the vulgar tongue of Gods people; as are tho≈øe prayers and ble≈ø≈øings which are read in the 6. of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> ver≈øe 23. and following, and in the 10. Chap. ver. 35. and 36. and then of thank≈øgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the oblation of fir≈øt-fruits, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. ver. 3. and the forme of prayer after the payment of Tithes in the third yeare, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. ver. 13. in a word, all the publique prayers which were made by the Prie≈øts or by the people, were made in a tongue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood by the people. And <hi>David</hi> dictated to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:11457:53"/> people P≈øalmes which were ≈øung in the Temple upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruments of Mu≈øique in the Hebrew tongue, which was the tongue u≈øed in I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</p>
               <p n="2">II. During the captivitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Hebrew tongue degenerated from it puritie. Notwith≈øtanding the which, the change was not ≈øo great, but that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew tongue, in the which <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and the Prophets writ, was ≈øtill under≈øtood by the Iewes. Not onely for that the people were exerci≈øed in the reading and hearing of tho≈øe bookes, as well in their private hou≈øes, as in the Synagogues euery Sabboth; but al≈øo for that the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not ≈øo great, but that the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> people ea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11457:54"/> under≈øtand the Hebrew, by rea≈øon of the proximitie and neare re≈øemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Iewi≈øh and the Hebrew tongue. Whence al≈øo in the new Te≈øtament the Iudaique tongue is often called the Hebrew; as in 27. of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> ver≈øe 33. where <hi>Golgotha,</hi> which is a word of the Iudaique tongue, is ≈øaid to be an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word: but the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews ≈øay <hi>Golgoleth,</hi> that is to ≈øay, <hi>≈øcalpe or ≈øcull,</hi> and in the Chap. 19. of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> ver≈øe 19. it is ≈øaid that <hi>Gabbatha</hi> in Hebrew ≈øignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth pavement, although <hi>Gabbatha</hi> bee a Syrian word. For that the Iewes after their returne from the captivitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> under≈øtood the Hebrew tongue, and the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:11457:54"/> Text of the bookes of the Lawe, appeares by the 8. Chapter of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> ver. 2. where it is ≈øaid that <hi>E≈ødras</hi> the Prie≈øt brought the law before the congregation of men and women, and of all them of hearing; and it is added that <hi>E≈ødras read in the booke in the pre≈øence of the men and of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and of as many as were capable to under≈øtand: and the eares of the people were atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the reading.</hi> This could not bee done in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the which the Deacon reades the Go≈øpell, and the Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con reades the Epi≈øtle in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine before women, pei≈øants, and trades-men, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand them not, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot bee atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

               <p>The expo≈øition which the Levites added unto this Lecture, which is mentioned in the Sequell, was not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the termes thereof into another tongue, but to expound the meaning and ≈øen≈øe of them, as <hi>Nicholas de Lyra</hi> acknowledgeth upon the 8. of <hi>Nehemiah.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Two cau≈øes which move the Pope and his Clergie, to will that the Ma≈ø≈øe, and the whole ordinary ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice be ≈øaid in the Latine tongue.</head>
               <p>PApi≈øtrie is a pile or tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie rather of doctrines and ceremonies, cemented and built with admirable skill. All the ≈øubtilties and coun≈øells &amp; cunning ≈øleights of humane wit have beene imployed in the framing of it. Whereupon it is not to be wondred at, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle ≈øtiles this ≈øtructure of the ≈øonne of perdition the my≈øterie of iniquitie.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:11457:72"/>
               <p>In this very point, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we treate, the Pope and his Clergie have propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them≈øelves two ends, whereof the former is to keepe the people in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and to inure them to beleeve without knowing, and to follow their eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blindfolded, and to obey without all enquirie into any thing: this evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in this, that they have entertained a feare, lea≈øt in deed the Latine ≈øhould bee too well under≈øtood, and therefore have ordered that the principall parts of the Ma≈ø≈øe ≈øhould bee ≈øaid in ≈øo low a fumbling murmure, that the Prie≈øts voice cannot be heard; to the ≈øame end tends their forbidding to reade the Scriptures. And
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11457:73"/> Images, and implicite faith, and their Maxime that the Pope cannot erre in the faith. For in effect his empire is founded upon the blindne≈ø≈øe of the people, and publique ignorance is his firme≈øt prop.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond end which the Pope propounds to him≈øelfe in the e≈øtabli≈øhment of the Latine tongue in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ≈øervice, hath beene to plant among the nations, he hath conquered the badges and cogni≈øances of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The cu≈øtome and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of great Monarcks, is to give their language to the people ≈øubdued by them, to the end to civilize and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them unto their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement. Thus did the Romanes to the <hi>Gaules</hi> and

                  <hi>Spani≈øh,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> ties the <hi>Indians</hi> to ≈øpeake <hi>Spani≈øh:</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> in their language, become al≈øo ≈øuch in affection. The Pope doth the like, in giving to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he hath conquered, his tongue together with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The ≈øimple people thinke, that their religion ought to be Romi≈øh as well as the tongue, which is u≈øed in that religion, and that the Chri≈øtian faith, and the tongue came both to them from the ≈øame place.</p>

               <p>BVt the principall cau≈øe why the Pope will not have the Ma≈ø≈øe to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood by every one, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Ma≈ø≈øe containes many things, which if the people under≈øtood, they would thereby bee either in≈øtructed, or ≈øcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
               <p>For the Ma≈ø≈øe is full of clau≈øes, whereof ≈øome of them are contrary to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:11457:74"/> and are conformable to our Religion, others of them are clearely oppo≈øite and contrary to the doctrine of the Go≈øpell, and ≈øome of them contrary to common ≈øen≈øe.</p>
               <p n="1">I.

This rea≈øon

The Apo≈øtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> Chapter 10. tells us, that faith comes by hearing of the Word of God, not then by an a≈ø≈øi≈øtance without under≈øtanding that which God propoundeth unto us in his Word.

               <p>In the yeare 596.

               <p>This <hi>Austin</hi> came to <hi>England</hi> with a traine of fortie per≈øons, and pre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him≈øelfe to one of the pettie kings named <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>received him with honour.

They
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:11457:145"/> had in a Towne called <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor</hi> a great Mona≈øtery, wherein there were ≈øome twelve hundred Monkes, who were all poore arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øans getting their living by their trade: of whom this Pagan King made a ma≈ø≈øacre and a ≈øacrifice unto <hi>Augu≈øtine,</hi> but as for the Saxon Chri≈øtians converted by <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> from Pagani≈øme, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Romane ≈øervice, ≈øuch as <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> plea≈øed to give them, and ≈øubjected them≈øelves to <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtine</hi> ≈øent by the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the yeare 600. of our Lord.

                  <hi>Bede</hi> in the 4. book of his Hi≈øtorie ≈øaith that in the yeare of our Lord 668. one ≈øurnamed, <hi>Stephen</hi> taught the people of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to follow the Romi≈øh ≈øinging in publike ≈øervice As then the Romi≈øh ≈øervice was not yet received in <hi>France,</hi> nor in <hi>Spaine.</hi> This ≈øelfe-≈øame <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> pa≈ø≈øing

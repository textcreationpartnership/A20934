            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>if the Church of GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any benefit by this my labour her obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will bee acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto you for the ſame. For in the anſwer which I made unto the
<pb facs="tcp:11457:5"/> Cardinall <hi>Du Perron,</hi> when it happened I had improvidently omitted the Chapter which trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of an unknowne tongue: You advertiſed me of that defect, and moved me to ſupply the ſame. I have condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to your motion, and have compoſed this Treatiſe, which I heere tender unto you. You ſhall receive it, if you pleaſe, for a teſtimony of my hearty affection, and of that joy which I receive by ſeeing you ſerve in the worke of the
<pb facs="tcp:11457:6"/> Lord with ſo great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. It is a comfort to me amidſt ſo many deſolations to ſee that God cauſeth to ſpring up lights to ſhine in the darkneſſe which grow thicker from day to day. For ſeeing God raiſeth up good work-men and labourers, it is a ſigne that he will yet leave us ſome harveſt. Hee who from your infancie hath indued his feare, and hath ſet you apart for his ſervice, will cloath you with ſtrength, and with courage not to faint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:11457:6"/> the burthen. For you are entred upon your charge in a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſhall have need of double zeale, and of an holy magnanimitie: It ſhall be a great honour for you to ſtand in the breach, and in the ſhock of the maine battle: and amidſt the darkneſſe of the time to be the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of ſo faire a light. There ſhall you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of thoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to thoſe which love him, and who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it a great honour
<pb facs="tcp:11457:7"/> and gaine to looſe their lives or goods for his ſervice. He, who hath given unto trees, which grow on the tops of the rocks, ſtronger roots, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the boiſterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the winds, will give unto you alſo ſtrength according to the meaſure of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, whereunto he will expoſe you. The match indeed ſeemeth very unequall, and the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe no leſſe difficult, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as if with pinnes we ſhould take in hand to
<pb facs="tcp:11457:7"/> ſupplant a rocke. But we muſt remember, that we defend Gods cauſe, who is wont to uſe the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt tooles or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the effecting of his workes of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: that the glory of the ſucceſſe might not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to our ſtrength. And that the heavenly truth, were it plunged downe unto bottome of the bottomeleſſe deeps, might at laſt regaine the upper hand. And as the Church is more firme then the world; ſeeing the world was made for
<pb facs="tcp:11457:8"/> it. VVhereunto may be applied what is written of the cittie of <hi>Iericho,</hi> to wit, that he that built it, laid her foundation upon his firſt borne. The ſame God, who at the ſound of <hi>Ioſua's</hi> tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets made his enemies walls to fall flat to the ground, will one day make to fall downe the walls of <hi>Babylon</hi> at the blaſt of the trumpet of the Goſpell. But if by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ingratitude of this ſtiffe-neckt age, God putteth off unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time ſo excellent
<pb facs="tcp:11457:8"/> a worke, we which have ſowed on earth with ſmall ſucceſſe, ſhall not faile to reape abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heaven. We beare, like <hi>Gedeons</hi> ſouldiers, this light in earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: namely, in weake bodies, the breaking whereof will be happie and honourable, if it may but ſerve to ſet forth in ſight the light of the Goſpell.

In the matter of Gods ſervice, men admire moſt, what they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand leaſt; and obſcuritie augments reverence, and herewith fareth it as with beauties; the which when men doe nothing but ſtand at enterview and at gaze, they kindle and inflame the more concupiſcence.</p>
               <p>Negligence and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe contribute to this evill; For men having no naturall inclination to bee inſtructed in the knowledge of God, they uoluntarily disburden themſelves of that care upon them that make profeſſion to inſtruct them; rather then they will take the paines to learne, they had rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve without knowing, and follow others without any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11457:13"/> further inquiſition to informe themſelves; and this affected ignorance cloketh it ſelfe with the ſpecious title of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect towards the Church, and of quickneſſe of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; if there be queſtion of putting forth a mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, there men will be ſure to enquire out the beſt ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and men are in this point full of diffidence and diſtruſt: but when the point of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion falleth into debate, they referre themſelves to rely on the faith of another, and blindfold their owne eyes with a uoluntarie ignorance.</p>

               <p>They that have the charge to guide and inſtruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have beene carefull to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and increaſe this evill; for they endevour to keepe the people in ignorance, with-holding from them the key of knowledge, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Ieſus Christ</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">

By this meanes they make themſelves reſpectable and of account, as ſuch that are onely capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding divine matters the things that belong to God, and having onely and alone a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11457:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> familiar communication with God. And by the ſelfe ſame meanes, they themſelves take ſanctuary, and hinder, that there can no cleare inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be made into their affaires; and gaine the liberty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate religion to their owne profit, and to carve and ſhred it at their pleaſure. Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as theeves do, that blowe out the candells for feare of being diſcride; for they are afraid, leaſt the things which men admire a farre off, being knowne and better taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of at a nearer diſtance, ſhould become contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vtterly out of requeſt: Like unto painted women, who would not willingly bee uiewed neere at hand; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving learned by experience, that there is trouble to lead
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11457:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ignorant; and that it is eaſieſt diving into a blinde mans purſe, and that every man that would be informed in the reaſon and originall of things is not eaſily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Hence commeth it that they withdraw the people from reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that they hinder the tranſlating of them into the vulgar tongue. Hence commeth it, that they labour ſo much to caſt an aſperſion upon the Scriptures, and to make them to be ſuſpected by the people, as a dangerous booke; and that the reading thereof is the cauſe of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. Hence came in Images, which ſerve to amaze, and to holde at gaze the eyes whilſt they blinde their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11457:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> and to afford them recreation, whilſt they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and bereave the of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction Hence came that heape of Ceremonies, which are ſhaddowes, which growe apace, and ſtretch out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in length, when the night of ignorance is neere at hand. Hence came that implicit faith, which relyeth on the faith of another, and which beleeveth that which the Church of his countrey beleeveth, without ever knowing that which the Church ought to beleeve: and which ſerveth God by cuſtome, following the thronge, and involveing themſelves in the multitude. Hence came in the Liturgie in a ſtrange tongue, and not underſtood; as if the engliſh
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11457:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> tongue were too baſe and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall for divine ſervice. Hence came in the cuſtome of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God without knowing what they asked of him; as if they were affraid to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand themſelves. Hence came it to paſſe, that as in the publique reading of the Scriptures; God is a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian unto men, ſo alſo in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique prayers the Prieſt is a barbarian to the Aſſembly, and in the prayers of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, every one is a barbarian to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The occaſions and the change of affaires, have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto often contributed: For the vulgar tongue of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey comming to be abbaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſed by laps of time, or being ſuddenly changed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd medley, the blending,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11457:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> and invndation and uiolent breaking in of ſtrange peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Paſtors and leaders of the people have not beene carefull to accommodate the publique ſervice unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the new inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and to the tongue in vſe: So that the Liturgie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in leſſe then fiftie yeares, not to be underſtood by the people And this came to paſſe in <hi>Italie,</hi> where the Latine was the vulgar in the time of the Apoſtles, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages after: But the Latine being corrupted by the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>Goths, Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and by the extinguiſhing &amp; aboliſhing of good letters and learning; the Biſhops ſtill retained the ſervice in the ancient tongue, and ſuffered the people to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11457:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> looſe the underſtanding of it: The like happened in <hi>France</hi> and in <hi>Spaine,</hi> as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
               <p>True religion taketh a quite contrary way. It reſiſts this naturall inclination of men, by which they flie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, fearing to learne the will of God, leaſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to follow it: thorow the brightneſſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it diſſipates the kingdome of the Prince of darkneſſe: For the people ought to bee clearely inſtructed in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſaluation; ſeeing they have as great a ſhare in ſalvation as the Paſtors. Who ſhall not anſwer for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at the day of iudgement: <hi>if the blinde leade the blinde,</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Two differences betweene us and the Church of Rome, touching an unknowne tongue.</head>
               <p>COncerning an unknowne tongue; when we ſpeake unto God, or when God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth unto us; wee have two ſorts of differences with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the prayers of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, the other tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the publique ſervice: For in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the people uſe to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to ſpeake unto God and unto the Saints in a tongue, which he that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth underſtandeth not, as if
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:11457:23"/> it were ſuſpected to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or they were afraid to underſtand their own prayer: thinking that the Latine hath ſomething in it that's more holy, and that barbarous termes have more efficacie, and that prayer in<note n="*" place="margin">Or in any other tongue then Latine.</note> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh is leſſe acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>The very ſame abuſe hath intruded it ſelfe into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſervice, which is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Latine, where the people of <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Wherevpon alſo the people vſe to ſay, <hi>let's goe heare a Maſſe;</hi> but not, <hi>let us goe obſerve the words, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Maſſe,</hi> they might ſay farre better if they ſaid, let us goe ſee the Maſſe; for they goe to it, as unto a ſhew, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:11457:24"/> not as unto an inſtruction; and as if it were not enough that the Maſſe is ſaid in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; a great part of the Maſſe is pronounced ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding lowe, and with a deepe ſilence: the reſt is ſaid in confuſed termes, and with quivering of an inarticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late voice: whereof their Doctors render us the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, namely, for that She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheards in hearing of the Maſſe having learned the words of conſecration,<note place="margin">Durand.

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of prayers of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a tongue not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by themſelves that pray.</head>
               <p n="1">I. PRayer is a requeſt or ſupplication, which man preſenteth unto God, forwarded and ſuggeſted by the ſenſe and feeling of our want and neceſſitie, it is a kinde of almes which man asketh of God. Whence it followeth, that hee that prayeth ought to pray ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his feeling, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11457:25"/> to apply his prayer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly unto his neceſſitie; this cannot be done by him that prayeth without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding himſelfe, and who by cuſtome ſayeth a prayer in terms not underſtood: very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it falleth out, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which hath an intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to aske of God ſomething, ſaith in his Latine prayers things farre from his owne inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Thus Courtizans and women, that underſtand the Latine iuſt as much as the Greeke, doe ſay in Latine their ſeaven Pſalmes;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 143.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>David</hi> being ſicke, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth that hee halteth as he goeth, and that his raines were enflamed, and ſpeaketh as one ſhut up in a darke Cave, whither <hi>Saul</hi> had brought him: is it credible,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11457:25"/> that a ſilly woman pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing theſe things in Latine, once thinkes of asking ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes?</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in his 1. Chap. wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, that when we aske any thing of God, <hi>wee aske it in faith, not doubting at all.</hi> Now it is impoſſible to aske of God any thing in faith and in full aſſurance, when the thing is not knowne which is asked of God, for faith implyeth and bringeth knowledge. Wherevpon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt conioyneth ordinarily know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with faith, as in the 10 of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> ver. 38. <hi>That you may know and beleeve that the Father is in me:</hi> and in the 17. Chap. ver. 8. <hi>They
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11457:26"/> have knowne and beleeved that thou hast ſent me.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſteed that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſo often ſaith, that we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faith. <hi>Eſay</hi> in his 53. Chap. ver. 11. ſaith, that wee are iuſtified by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="3">III. One cannot accuſe a man in plainer tearmes to bee out of his wits, then in ſaying to him; <hi>You know not what you ſay.</hi> But all things which in civill converſation would bee eſteemed abſurd, in the Romiſh religion are held for good: as if reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſerved to trouble the wits, or were a receptacle of abſurdities; and that which otherwaies is a folly, here is a devotion. God then ſhall deale iuſtly to grant nothing to that perſon, that knowes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:11457:26"/> not what he askes; and by conſequent knoweth this, that God hath denied him.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Here experience and neceſſitie reforme men by force; for they who ſhall have all their life long, made their prayers in latine without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of themſelves, in ſuddaine afflictions and in great griefes will change their language, and will caſt forth unto God their fervent prayers in their ordinarie tongue. A man which is in the pangues of death, or that is upon the Iibbet (unleſſe he bee utterly brutiſh) will never ſay <hi>Beati quorum,</hi> nor the <hi>Pater</hi> in Latine.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But what good grace can a Latine prayer have, which a poore ſilly woman ſaith to S. <hi>Mary</hi> the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:11457:27"/> or to S. Magdaleine who never underſtood the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine? And albeit that indeed they had learned their Latine in Paradiſe, yet ſo it is, that all that is nothing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the voice without knowing the heart: it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that he on whom wee muſt call, doe know the faith and the repentance of him, that prayeth leaſt he heare an hypocrite. Now the Word of God teacheth us, that God alone knoweth the hearts of men, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. ver. 30.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Above all to be pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the Latine prayer of a woman, or of an Artizan, which prayeth to S. <hi>Vrſula,</hi> or to S. <hi>Margarite,</hi> or to S. <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> or to S. <hi>Chryſtopher,</hi> or to S. <hi>Martial,</hi> or to S. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gius,</hi> or to S. <hi>Lazarus</hi> patron of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:11457:27"/> or to the eleve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thouſand Virgins, which are Saints, and yet never were men, and which are placed in heaven, and yet never lived upon the earth, by this meanes he that prayeth, ſpeaketh to a Saint, which hath no being at all, in a tongue which hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that prayeth underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, which is an heape of abſurditie.<note n="*" place="margin">Theſe are not the calves of the lips, but the lips of calves. Oſee <hi>14.2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Hi non ſunt vituli labiorum, ſed labia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulorum, Oſea</hi> 14.2.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. That if unto a man that prayeth in Latine, not underſtanding that which he ſaith, any one had given one of <hi>Eſops</hi> fables in Latine, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him, that it is a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> ſuch a man, according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> pronouncing this fable
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:11457:28"/> with fervent affection, ſhould not ceaſe to pray in faith, and ſhould not looſe the merit of his prayer.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That if a French man not underſtanding the Germane tongue, ſhould come and aske ſomething of the King in the high Dutch, the King although he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the high Dutch, would take this diſcourſe for a mockerie, or would thinke ſuch a man to be beſide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. In this point the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Ieſus Chriſt ought to ſerve us for a rule, who preſcribing a forme of prayer unto his Diſciples, gave them one in their uſuall and ordinarie tongue, ſaying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>When you pray, ſay our Father which art in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11457:28"/> &amp;c.</hi> He gave them not this prayer in the <hi>Byſcane,</hi> nor in the <hi>Arabian.</hi> For he would have them when they prayed, know what they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of God; and what were the things whereof they ſtood in need.</p>
               <p n="10">X. And with ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent art is this prayer framed and compoſed; that the faithfull ſpeaking unto God, ſpeaketh alſo unto himſelfe, and that every petition is a commandement; for as the commandements of God are the matter of our prayers, and teach us that which wee ought to aske of God; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the petitions which God hath preſcribed us containe the commandements. In asking of God that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may come, we oblige
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:11457:29"/> and binde over our ſelves to labour for the advancement of this kingdome. In asking and praying that the name of God may be hallowed, wee are advertiſed to hallowe it our ſelves; and we are taught by this prayer, not to covet another mans bread, and to forgive them that have treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed againſt us, and to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew the temptations of evill; leſſons which cannot be compriſed by him, that underſtands not himſelfe, and prayeth in a tongue which hee underſtands not.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. True it is that God underſtands all tongues; but withall, his pleaſure is, that he that ſpeaketh unto him, know what he ſaith, and that he ſpeake as a man, and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature, that is to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11457:29"/> ſay, with reaſon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. God indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands thy tongue; but withall, he underſtands that thou underſtands not thy ſelfe; it is a grand abuſe to thinke that wee ſpeake unto God, to the end hee might underſtand our language; for before wee opened our mouthes hee knew our thoughts; and it is bee that puts prayer into the heart of them that feare him: now it is the heart that muſt move the lips, and ſuggeſt to the mouth words conformable to the thought.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Thus prayed the Prophets: <hi>David</hi> prayed in his owne tongue, and dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the Pſalmes in a tongue they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: who whilſt they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11457:30"/> pronounced the Pſalmes of <hi>David,</hi> had this content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath deprived her ſelfe: reading in particular, and hearing read in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique the Pſalmes of <hi>David</hi> without all underſtanding of them.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. The prodigall childe returning home to his Father and ſaying; <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have ſinned againſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and before thee, I am not worthy to be called thy ſonne,</hi> underſtood himſelfe well: <hi>Luke</hi> 15.21. Thus prayed the poore Publican, ſmiting his breaſt, and ſaying, <hi>O God be mercifull unto mee a poore ſinner,</hi> Luke 18.13.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Thus prayed the Primitive Chriſtians for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11457:30"/> the Apoſtle to the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> Chap. 3. ver. 16. had taught them to exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mutually in Pſalmes and praiſes; ſo prayed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> where the faithfull uſed to goe forth of the towne, and met together by a river ſide to pray: <hi>Act.</hi> 16. verſe 13. For <hi>Lydia</hi> a ſeller of purple had not been touched either with his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or with his exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if hee had prayed, or ſpoke in a tongue which ſhee underſtood not. And none hath hitherto doubted but that the faithfull of the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in the time of the Apoſtles pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their vulgar tongue, when they prayed for the deliverance of Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:11457:31"/> being priſoner:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 12.5.</note> and that the Fathers when they prayed in their families, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> hath a whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon this ſubject; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the 14. wherein he utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemnes prayers in an unknowne tongue:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> That publique ſervice in a tongue not understood, is contrary to the Word of God, and to reaſon.</head>
               <p n="1">I. ABuſe in the Liturgie and publique ſervice is yet more pernitious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God himſelfe is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wrapped up, and made a barbarian unto men, and his word by this meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not intelligible: as if men would fruſtrate God of his intention, which is to ſpeake unto us to inſtruct us; as if Ieſus Chriſt came downe from heaven of purpoſe to ſpeake to men without being underſtood. For in the Maſſe there are not onely
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11457:37"/> prayers unto God, but alſo therein are read places of Scriptures in which God ſpeakes unto men. In pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in a tongue not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, there is uſed this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent excuſe, that God underſtands all tongues, as if we ſpake with the mouth; to the end, to be underſtood by God: But here where the buſineſſe is concerning God ſpeaking to men, this excuſe hath no place; for when God ſpeaketh unto men, hee will bee heard and underſtood: and indeed when for excuſe it is ſaid, that God underſtands al tongues, it is preſuppoſed that he unto whom he ſpeaketh, ſhould underſtand that which is ſaid unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:11457:37"/> teacheth us that when God is provoked to diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt his people; hee makes them heavie of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that they may not heare, and that their hearts may not underſtand; as God himſelfe ſpeaketh by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay.</hi> Chap. 6. verſe 10.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Beſides it is alſo one of Gods curſes, wherewith hee puniſheth the ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and the contempt of his word, when he ſpeakes to a people in a ſtrange tongue, that they may not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, as the Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in the firſt to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> Chap. 14. where he bringeth in God ſpeaking thus by his Prophet <hi>Eſay.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 25.11.</note> 
                  <hi>I will ſpeake to this people by men of another tongue,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:11457:38"/> and by ſtrange lips, and thus they ſhall not understand, ſaith the Lord. Wherefore tongues are for a ſigne not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beleevers, but vnto infidells.</hi> This threatning is fulfilled in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God puniſheth the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mens hearts by ſpeaking unto them in a tongue which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. In this matter this maxime taken out of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, and from the intention of the creature ought to be laid for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; namely, that the tongue was given unto man to be the interpreter of his thoughts, and meſſenger of his conceptions. Whence it followeth that to uſe the tongue to a contrarie end,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:11457:38"/> and to ſpeake to the end to be not underſtood, is to turne nature topſie turvie and quite to overthrowe her; and as much as in us lyeth to fruſtrate the Creator of his intention: and to change humane ſpeech into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Echo, and into a ſound beating the aire. Now if this bee true in him which ſpeaketh to others in a tongue which he underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, it is yet more true in him which is underſtood neither by himſelfe nor by another.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Out of the ſelfe ſame maxime, it followeth that when the Prieſt ſpeaketh La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine in the Church, he ought to ſpeake to bee underſtood by ſome body. Our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries muſt tell us, whether he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:11457:39"/> ſpeake to bee underſtood by the aſſiſtants, or to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by himſelfe, or to bee underſtood by God, for there is no fourth. Now hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not to be underſtood of the by-ſtanders, ſeeing hee ſpeaketh ſo very lowe, and in a tongue which the people underſtand not: and beſides, in private Maſſes hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth alone and without any aſſiſtants: Beſides he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not to be underſtood of God; for God underſtands us without our ſpeaking, though we ſpeake not at all, and before wee open our mouthes: nor can it rather be ſaid, that the Prieſt in the Maſſe ſpeaketh to the end to be underſtood by himſelfe, for hee knew his owne thought before hee ſpake:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11457:39"/> ſpeech was given man not to informe himſelfe in his own thoughts, but to the end to make it knowne to another; he is utterly beſide himſelfe that ſpeaketh to himſelfe, to the end, to underſtand him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Add herevnto, that in many places of the Maſſe, the Prieſt ſpeaketh to the people, ſaying unto them, <hi>Oremus, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Orate pro me fratres, &amp;c.</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Prieſt bids the people aske of God ſuch and ſuch things, and to ioyne their prayers with his: but the people have no minde to obey that his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not ſo much as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the Prieſt bids them doe; the people might
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:11457:40"/> iuſtly ſay to him, <hi>make us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand thee, if thou wilt be obeyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. Wherefore in the Church of the Old Teſtament, the whole publique ſervice was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the vulgar tongue; and the prayers which <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Succeſſors made for the Hebrew people were made in the Hebrew tongue: which after the captivitie of <hi>Babylon</hi> being corrupted, yet was ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the people, as wee will ſhew hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt inſtituted and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the holy Supper amongſt his Diſciples in the vulgar tongue, and that which was underſtood by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:11457:40"/> the aſſiſtants; his will was, that when the faithfull ſhall <hi>eat of that bread, and drinke of that cup, they ſhew forth the Lords death untill he come againe.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. Now this is not to ſhew forth a thing, to propound it in an unknowne tongue, not underſtood.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. To this very ſelfe ſame end he gave unto his Apoſtles the gift of divers tongues, to the end, that in all nations they might eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the ſervice of God in the tongue of the countrey, and that in every tongue God might be ſerved, in ſuch ſort, that the diverſitie of tongues which at the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Babel</hi> was a curſe, at the building of the Church is become a bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:11457:41"/>X. The Apoſtles followed their Maſters example; for the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that were Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, gave them in their owne tongue the forme of the Celebration of the holy Supper. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Would Ieſus Chriſt who is the light of the world come to plunge it in darkneſſe, and to make things more obſcure? And God having ſpoken to his people by <hi>Moſes</hi> in a tongue underſtood, would hee now wrap and infold up himſelfe in darkneſſe by propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Word, and by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Sacraments in a barbarous and an unknowne tongue?</p>
               <p n="12">XII. But that which is yet of more ſtrength in this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11457:41"/> matter, and which clearely decides, and fully determins this controverſie, is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who imployed the 14. Chapter of his 1. Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in a manner wholly to condemne the uſe of ſtrange tongues, and not underſtood in the Church. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the trumpet give an uncertaine ſound, who ſhall be prepared to the warre? So likewiſe you, except you utter words which may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, how ſhall it be knowne what is ſpoken? For yee ſhall ſpeake unto the aire,</hi> and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after. <hi>Wherefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I ſhall bee a barbarian to him that ſpeaketh, and hee that ſpeaketh ſhall be a barbarian to me:</hi> and a little after: <hi>If
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11457:42"/> thou bleſſe with the ſpirit, how ſhal he that occupieth the place of the unlearned, ſay Amen, at thy giving of thankes; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he underſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt? Thou verily gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt thankes well, but another is not thereby edified.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he concludeth, <hi>I had rather in the Church ſpeake five words with my underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that I may teach others alſo then ten thouſand words in an unknowne tongue.</hi>
               </p>

Paul, ſignifieth an unknown tongue.</note>XIII. Mounſieur <hi>du Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> anſwereth, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh not of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue which was in the Church, but of tongues infuſed and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. This I willingly agree to, for this augments the force of that place againſt the ordinarie ſervice in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11457:42"/> tongue. For theſe miraculous gifts of tongues were rare, and given unto ſome Chriſtians for a ſmall time; to the end to declare the power of God, and by conſequent the uſe of them in the Church brought with them a benefit, which the Maſſe in Latine cannot bring. Nevertheleſſe, the Apoſtle forbids them the uſe of this miraculous guift in the Church, unleſſe they interpret them inſtantly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will have nothing ſpoken in the Church which is not underſtood. How much more condemnes hee a ſtrange language in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie ſervice, wherein that extraordinary evill which the Apoſtle would avoid, would become ordinarie?
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11457:43"/> The Apoſtle forbids not an unknowne tongue in the Church, for that it is mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: but becauſe it is not underſtood, and becauſe that he which ſpeaketh is a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian to him that heareth him; &amp; becauſe that is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which is ſpoken, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is to ſpeak in the aire, &amp; becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſay Amen to the thankſgiving, they underſtand not; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that they that heare are not thereby edified, which are truly reaſons of moment: be it that he which ſpeakes in an unknowne tongue in the Church, have learned that tongue by miracle or by ſtudie, the queſtion here is not of the manner by which a tongue is learned, but of the peoples inſtruction. Saint
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11457:43"/> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had learned without miracle the Hebrew tongue; and yet for all that would he not celebrate at <hi>Corinth,</hi> or at <hi>Rome</hi> the holy Supper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Gentiles, in the Hebrew tongue; in a word he gives two generall rules and without exception. The one it is better to ſpeake in the Church five words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, then ten thouſand not underſtood. The other, it is a curſe of God, when he ſpeaketh to a people in a tongue they underſtand not.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Others goe about to eſcape by another way. They ſay that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes not of the ordinarie ſervice which is ſaid in the Church, but of certaine hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11457:44"/> In ſpeaking thus they would perſwade us, that ſuch hymnes ought to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in a tongue under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but that the reſt of the ſervice was ſaid in a tongue not underſtood by the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> but this they know to be falſe. It being a thing well knowne, that in <hi>Greece</hi> the publique ſervice was ever performed and ſaid in Greeke, and is ſo ſaid yet to this day. So that if ſuch hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs ought to be pronounced in a tongue underſtood, then much more the ordinarie prayers and the reading of Gods Word, whence the people receive more edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. But it is eaſy for us to prove that the Apoſtle in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11457:44"/> this place ſpeaketh of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter then of hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs. For when hee ſaith that ſtrange tongues are for a ſigne, not unto the beleevers, but unto unbeleevers: and ranketh that amongſt the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and curſes of God; when God threatens to ſpeake to a people in a ſtrange tongue, to the end, not to be underſtood; it is cleere that he ſpeaketh not of hymnes or ſongs in which men ſpeake unto God, but of the Word of God, which is directed unto men.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. And when the Apoſtle ſaith, that hee had rather ſpeake five words in the Church underſtood to inſtruct others, then tenne
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:11457:45"/> thouſand in a tongue, it is evident he ſpeaketh of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſpoken in the Church.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. And theſe words, <hi>If I know not what is ſignified by the words, I ſhall be a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian to him that ſpeaketh, and he that ſpeaketh ſhall be a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian unto me;</hi> are they not alſo as true in him that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Scriptures in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, as in him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth hymnes?

               <p>BY what hath beene hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſaid, it appeareth that in this queſtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a tongue not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which is uſed in the publique ſervice, we have the Word of God, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the confeſſion of our Adverſaries on our ſide. Wherevnto we muſt add the example of the ancient Church, as well of the old as of the new Teſtament, which ought to ſerve us for a rule.</p>
               <p n="1">I. To fetch the matter
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:11457:53"/> from the beginning: God gave his lawe in a tongue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: and the forme of prayers and bleſſings, which God preſcribed to <hi>Aaron</hi> to make before the people, was in the vulgar tongue of Gods people; as are thoſe prayers and bleſſings which are read in the 6. of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> verſe 23. and following, and in the 10. Chap. ver. 35. and 36. and then of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the oblation of firſt-fruits, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. ver. 3. and the forme of prayer after the payment of Tithes in the third yeare, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. ver. 13. in a word, all the publique prayers which were made by the Prieſts or by the people, were made in a tongue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the people. And <hi>David</hi> dictated to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:11457:53"/> people Pſalmes which were ſung in the Temple upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Muſique in the Hebrew tongue, which was the tongue uſed in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</p>
               <p n="2">II. During the captivitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Hebrew tongue degenerated from it puritie. Notwithſtanding the which, the change was not ſo great, but that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew tongue, in the which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets writ, was ſtill underſtood by the Iewes. Not onely for that the people were exerciſed in the reading and hearing of thoſe bookes, as well in their private houſes, as in the Synagogues euery Sabboth; but alſo for that the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not ſo great, but that the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11457:54"/> underſtand the Hebrew, by reaſon of the proximitie and neare reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Iewiſh and the Hebrew tongue. Whence alſo in the new Teſtament the Iudaique tongue is often called the Hebrew; as in 27. of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> verſe 33. where <hi>Golgotha,</hi> which is a word of the Iudaique tongue, is ſaid to be an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word: but the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews ſay <hi>Golgoleth,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>ſcalpe or ſcull,</hi> and in the Chap. 19. of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> verſe 19. it is ſaid that <hi>Gabbatha</hi> in Hebrew ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth pavement, although <hi>Gabbatha</hi> bee a Syrian word. For that the Iewes after their returne from the captivitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> underſtood the Hebrew tongue, and the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:11457:54"/> Text of the bookes of the Lawe, appeares by the 8. Chapter of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> ver. 2. where it is ſaid that <hi>Eſdras</hi> the Prieſt brought the law before the congregation of men and women, and of all them of hearing; and it is added that <hi>Eſdras read in the booke in the preſence of the men and of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and of as many as were capable to underſtand: and the eares of the people were atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the reading.</hi> This could not bee done in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the which the Deacon reades the Goſpell, and the Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con reades the Epiſtle in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine before women, peiſants, and trades-men, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them not, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot bee atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

               <p>PApiſtrie is a pile or tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie rather of doctrines and ceremonies, cemented and built with admirable skill. All the ſubtilties and counſells &amp; cunning ſleights of humane wit have beene imployed in the framing of it. Whereupon it is not to be wondred at, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſtiles this ſtructure of the ſonne of perdition the myſterie of iniquitie.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:11457:72"/>
               <p>In this very point, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we treate, the Pope and his Clergie have propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to themſelves two ends, whereof the former is to keepe the people in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and to inure them to beleeve without knowing, and to follow their eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blindfolded, and to obey without all enquirie into any thing: this evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in this, that they have entertained a feare, leaſt in deed the Latine ſhould bee too well underſtood, and therefore have ordered that the principall parts of the Maſſe ſhould bee ſaid in ſo low a fumbling murmure, that the Prieſts voice cannot be heard; to the ſame end tends their forbidding to reade the Scriptures. And
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11457:73"/> Images, and implicite faith, and their Maxime that the Pope cannot erre in the faith. For in effect his empire is founded upon the blindneſſe of the people, and publique ignorance is his firmeſt prop.</p>
               <p>The ſecond end which the Pope propounds to himſelfe in the eſtabliſhment of the Latine tongue in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſervice, hath beene to plant among the nations, he hath conquered the badges and cogniſances of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The cuſtome and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of great Monarcks, is to give their language to the people ſubdued by them, to the end to civilize and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them unto their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement. Thus did the Romanes to the <hi>Gaules</hi> and

The Pope doth the like, in giving to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he hath conquered, his tongue together with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The ſimple people thinke, that their religion ought to be Romiſh as well as the tongue, which is uſed in that religion, and that the Chriſtian faith, and the tongue came both to them from the ſame place.</p>

               <p>BVt the principall cauſe why the Pope will not have the Maſſe to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by every one, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Maſſe containes many things, which if the people underſtood, they would thereby bee either inſtructed, or ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>

               <p n="2">II. Alſo the people that are taught to pray for the ſoules departed out of this

               <p n="3">III. So the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being taught to beleeve, that after the words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:11457:75"/> the bread is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into the bodie of our Lord, and that, that which the Prieſt holds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his hands, is not bread, but the naturall body of Ieſus Chriſt, would bee much amaſed to heare the Prieſt ſay theſe words over the conſecrated Hoſte: <hi>Per quem [Christum] haec omnia, Domine, ſemper bona creas, ſanctificas, vivificas, benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, &amp; praeſtas nobis. By the which Ieſus Chriſt, ô Lord, thou createst for us daily all theſe good things thou ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est them, and dost bleſſe them, and dost beſtowe them upon us.</hi> For he would thinke it very ſtrange, that the Prieſt calls the body of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>all theſe good things:</hi> and that the Prieſt ſayes, that God

Or if the Prieſt deſire the Angell to come, and take the Hoaſt from betweene his hands, Why doth hee eate it a little while after theſe words? Why ſtaies hee not the comming of the Angell? It ſeemes then hee feares he is not heard, as alſo that in calling Ieſus Chriſt <hi>Theſe things,</hi> hee ſpeakes manifeſtly againſt his owne intention, for Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is not theſe things, but a perſon.</p>
               <p>And here will preſent it ſelfe againe the ſame thought: that is, that theſe prayers are good being ſaid over the Almes, and over ſome quantitie of Bread and Wine not Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

For ordinarily when the Prieſt pronounceth theſe words, there is no body that taketh or eateth after the Prieſt. And the private Maſſes are without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. It might alſo fall out that ſome one of the people more curious then others would take the boldneſſe to ſearch the holy Scriptures, and would obſerve that the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:11457:81"/> Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chapter 11. verſe 24. wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth that Ieſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This is my body which is broken for you.</hi> And there above out of a curioſitie which is doubtleſſe the way to hereſie, would be inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, why the Prieſt omits theſe words, <hi>which is broken for you.</hi> For theſe are the words that are the deciders of the difference. It being moſt cleere and evident, that as the body of our Lord in the Euchariſt is not broken really, but ſacramentally; that ſo alſo the bodie of our Lord is not really but ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally betweene the hands of the Prieſt. Nor is there any reaſon to require that theſe words <hi>which is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:11457:82"/> broken for you</hi> ſhould bee a Sacramentall and figurative manner of ſpeech, and that theſe words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> ſhould be taken in any other manner. In a word, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the bread in the Sacrament is in the ſame manner the body of Chriſt, as that it is broken in. Now broken it is not really, nor then likewiſe is the body of Ieſus Chriſt therein broken really. But Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to damne and ſtop up this window, thorough which the light ſhineth in unto us ſo clearely, having this Word utterly out of the Bibles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in ſteed of <hi>frangitur,</hi> there is inſerted <hi>tradetur,</hi> in ſteed of <hi>is broken,</hi> they have put <hi>ſhall be given.</hi>

                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:11457:82"/>X. From the bread the Prieſt paſſeth to the Cup, and recites the words of our Lord, ſaying, that Ieſus Chriſt having taken the Cup, ſaid, <hi>Accipite, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite ex eo omnes. Hic est enim calix ſanguinis mei novi &amp; aeterni Teſtamenti, myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um fidei. Take yee, drinke yee all hereof: for this is the Cup of my bloud of the New and eternall Testament, the Myſterie of faith.</hi> There alſo many ſubjects of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall offer themſelves. For ſeeing the Prieſt witneſſeth that Ieſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Drinke yee all hereof.</hi> Why is it the priviledge of Prieſts and Kings onely to drinke of this Cup? If it belong to Prieſts and Kings onely, that this word <hi>Drinke yee</hi> is directed,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:11457:83"/> then muſt the like be ſaid of this word <hi>Eate yee:</hi> For theſe words are directed to the ſame perſons. Then ſhould there bee none but Prieſts and Kings, that ought to eat of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Add moreover that the Apoſtles being in the company of Ieſus Chriſt, held not the ranke of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but of ſheepe, and of Diſciples. Therefore the Apoſtle willeth, that the people of <hi>Corinth examine themſelves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſo eat of this bread and drinke of this Cup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">XI. Above all, theſe words afford ſubject of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in this, that the Prieſt changeth the words of our Lord: For the words of the Maſſe are neither found in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:11457:83"/> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> nor in any of the Evangeliſts. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the Lord ſaid, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my bloud: doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me</hi> Excellent words. For theſe words <hi>This is my body,</hi> and thoſe, <hi>This Cup is the New Testament,</hi> ought to bee underſtood after the ſame manner. Now nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cup, nor that which is in it, is really a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, but ſacramentally and in ſignification. Nor then the bread, which they call the Hoaſt, is really the body of Ieſus Chriſt, but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, and in ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore that this might not be diſcerned, the words of our Lord have bene changed in the Text of the Maſſe. For in the place of

               <p n="12">XII.

               <p n="13">XIII. Behold here yet
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:11457:84"/> another ſubject of ſcruple &amp; of ſcandall, that the people would receive if the Maſſe were ſaid in a tongue under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: And this is it, A great while before the words which are called the words of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, there are prayers in the Maſſe, wherein the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſecrated bread is called the ſacrifice, or immaculate Hoaſt, which is offered to God for the ſinnes of the quicke and the dead, in theſe words,<note n="a" place="margin">Suſcipe hanc im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculatam hoſtiam, quam ego indignus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus tuns offero tibi Deo meo vivo &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, pro in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis &amp; offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionibus &amp; negligentijs meis, &amp; pro omnibus circumſtantibus, ſed &amp; pro omnibus fidelibus Chriſtianis vivis atque defunctis.</note> 
                  <hi>Receive this imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Hoast, which I thine unworthy ſervant offer unto thee my living and true God for my numberleſſe ſinnes and offences, and negligences, and for all them that ſtand round about, and withall for all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

For the unconſecrated bread is not the ſame Hoaſt with that which is conſecrated, which is ſaid to bee the true body of Ieſus Chriſt; by this meanes behold in the Maſſe two Hoaſts of divers natures, and two ſorts of Sacrifices. And that which is more ſtrange and of more difficult diſgeſtion is, that the Prieſt offers unto God in Sacrifice unconſecrated bread, for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for our ſinnes: Which is to offer a morſell of bread for payment for our ſinnes, and for the price of our redemption.</p>

                  <hi>It must not bee denied, that bread and wine are in ſome manner offered in the Maſſe.

               <p>But as concerning that, which the ſaid Cardinall ſaith, that theſe prayers are new, and brought in within theſe five hundred yeares, he ſaith true in ſome ſort. It is true, that it is a very new thing to ſacrifice unto God unconſecrated bread for the ſinnes of men. But to call the bread and the wine of the holy Supper, which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple brought, and which the Paſtor offered unto God, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and holy oblations, it is a thing very ancient, and a prayer conformable to the Word of God, which calls

               <p>But as for the publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in an unknowne tongue not underſtood, our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries propound ſome ſlender reaſons, which we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine.</p>
               <p n="1">I. They ſay that the title of the Croſſe was writ by <hi>Pilate</hi> in three tongues, in Hebrew, Greeke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, they will have <hi>Pilate;</hi> that was a Pagan Iudge, give this law to the Chriſtian Church. For being a man of great prudence, it is to be preſumed that he had a care that the Maſſe ſhould bee
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:11457:103"/> ſung in a fit tongue. Thus <hi>Pilates</hi> authoritie carieth it away, above the Word of God, and againſt the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Ieſus Chriſt, of the Prophets and of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. That if, according to the cuſtome of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, the title of the Croſſe had beene written but in one tongue, then ſhould they not, by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſing the Maſſe but in one tongue, or if <hi>Pilate</hi> had writ nothing, the Maſſe had not beene ſung at all.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Du Perron lib. <hi>6.</hi> of his book againſt the King of great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note>II. They have no better grace when they ſay, that it is expedient that divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice be ſaid thorowout and in all places in the ſame tongue, that ſtrangers may underſtand it. This reaſon
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:11457:103"/> contradicts the former, for if it be expedient, that divine ſervice be ſaid in one and the ſame tongue every where, then ſhall we be forced not to reſt upon the inſcription of the Croſſe in three tongues, and we ſhall be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſay ſervice in one onely tongue thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole univerſall Church.</p>
               <p>By the ſame reaſon, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ought to be made eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in the ſame tongue in favour of ſtrangers. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely the ſervice in Latine doth in no meaſure at all comfort the ſtrangers that are in <hi>France:</hi> For of theſe ſtrangers, three fourth parts at the leaſt underſtand not the Latine, and there will bee found in <hi>France,</hi> ten
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:11457:104"/> times moe ſtrangers which underſtand the French, then the Latine. And theſe ſtrangers which underſtand the Latine cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Maſſe, whereof a great part is pronounced in ſo low a voice, that they that are neere the Prieſt cannot heare his voice. But what ſhadow of reaſon is there for it, that in favour of a few ſtrangers, which are in great townes, all the people of <hi>France</hi> muſt be deprived of the underſtanding of divine ſervice? and eſpecially all the townes and Burroughes wherein there are no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? That if in one great Towne, as in <hi>Paris,</hi> they would gratifie ſtrangers, there ſhould be aſſigned for the <hi>Italians</hi> one Church,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:11457:104"/> wherein ſervice ſhould bee ſaid in <hi>Italian,</hi> and ſo of other nations, by this meanes every nation ſhould have at <hi>Paris</hi> the ſervice in their owne tongue.</p>
               <p n="3">III. They further add that to have every where the ſame tongue, is a ſigne of union, and of concord in the Catholike Church. In thus ſpeaking they declare that it would bee expedient, that the ſervice ſhould neither bee ſaid in Greeke, nor in Hebrew, tongues neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe which they ſay were authoriſed by the inſcription of the Croſſe. But the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God approveth and applaudeth in his Word, is not the vnion of one and the ſame tongue, but of faith and charitie.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:11457:105"/> Which vnion may bee amongſt thoſe of divers tongues; as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, men of the ſame tongue doe often diſſent in faith. Which is more. God is glorified, when in divers tongues hee is purely and unanimouſly ſerved &amp; called upon: as God himſelfe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth ſaying, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow before me, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tongue ſhall give glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.

For this it was that God gave to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles the gift of divers tongues, to the end, that in all tongues God might bee ſerved and called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">Du Perron the ſame.</note>IIII. Alſo preſuppoſing that divine ſervice bee not
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:11457:105"/> done for the inſtruction of the people, but onely to glorifie God by prayers, and thankſgiving, and by their aſſiſtance to bring their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto that which is done in the Church, and to be partakers of the fruits which the Church obtaines of God by the Liturgie, they ſay, that the people which underſtand not, looſe not theſe fruits, nor the ends for the which divine ſervice is inſtituted: becauſe that the Churches authoritie is a ſufficient caution and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie for the people: And that it is enough that the Paſtors underſtand for them. But by the ſame ends for the which they ſay that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice is inſtituted, it is eaſie to convince them.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:11457:106"/> For perſons aſſembled and met together to glorifie God by prayers and giving of thankes, ought to know that which they aske, and what they give thankes for. Now theſe <hi>Rabbines</hi> will have the people aske they wot not what, and give thankes for they know not why. And ſeeing that they will have the people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to yeeld their conſent to what is done and ſaid in the Church, how will they have them approve, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto things they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not? But if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſſiſt to participate in the good things which the Church receiveth by the publike ſervice, they aſſiſt then to bee inſtructed and comforted, for that is one
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:11457:106"/> of the fruits for which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice is inſtituted. And ſeeing that in the Maſſe the Prieſt ſpeaketh to the people, in vaine ſpeakes he to a people that underſtands him not. And ſeeing that in the Maſſe are read Chapters of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein God ſpeakes unto men, they ought not to hinder, that God bee not underſtood by men. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> Chapter 10. tells us, that faith comes by hearing of the Word of God, not then by an aſſiſtance without underſtanding that which God propoundeth unto us in his Word. And the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking to the people of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 26.</note> will that in eating the bread of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:11457:107"/> the Lords Supper, and in drinking of the Cup, they ſhew forth the Lords death, which cannot be done by perſons that aſſiſt without underſtanding the ſame. Of all theſe fruits are they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, that aſſiſt and are preſent at a ſervice where they underſtand not,</p>
               <p n="5">V. As for that, that <hi>Du Perron</hi> ſaith, that the Church ſtands for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples caution and ſecuritie: as if it could anſwer for the people at Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat; I ſay, that for this Church, that boaſts it ſelfe to bee a caution, it ſhall ſtand in need of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caution to give us aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that it erres not, and that God receives her for caution. Surely at the day
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:11457:107"/> of judgement, Prieſts ſhall not anſwer for the people. Hee ſhall finde himſelfe deceived and fowly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; who then would give his Curate for his cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Above all thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors ſhall not bee currant, who to enhaunſe their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and to leade the people on in ignorance at their pleaſure, have eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them from all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. But why may not the Greeke Church as well be caution as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane? Seeing the Greeke Church is more ancient then the Romane, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is but her daughter, and received from her the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and boaſts her ſelfe as well to bee Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:11457:108"/> and to have the chaires of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and of many Apoſtles?</p>

                  </note>VI. But ſaith this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, if to profit at a Maſſe it were neceſſarie to underſtand it, the deafe, and the perſons that ſtand a farre off from him that ſaith ſervice, ſhould receive no benefit by it, if this reaſon were of any weight. Then might we as well ſay, that we muſt preach in a tongue not underſtood, for though it were neceſſarie to preach in a tongue underſtood, yet the deafe, and ſuch as were at too farre a diſtance from the Preacher, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no profit by him. I ſay then, that where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of nature hinder from underſtanding what is ſaid,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:11457:108"/> we are not for that accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table before God: for God imputes not that for a crime which hee himſelfe hath done. But we ſtand accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto him for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments, and hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which we our ſelves lay in the way to hinder the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of his Word: God ſupplies the defects of nature by meanes, which are knowne to himſelfe: but man after hee hath done evills, cannot remedie them. If the light of the Sunne bee unprofitable to the blinde, it thence followeth, not that the eyes of them that ſee, muſt bee put out, even ſo if any be deafe, yet ought we not for that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the reſt of the people of vnderſtanding and he that

               <p>As for this that he ſaith of the French termes would become ridiculous at the end of two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares the ſame may be ſaid of the Latine and of the Greeke, and of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other tongue, whence it would follow that the Maſſe ſhould not bee ſaid in Latine, leaſt thorow laps of time the tearmes thereof might become ridiculous. The words which in the forme of divine ſervice, have beene kept become not ridiculous amongſt them that approve this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. In the publicke ſervice of the Romiſh Maſſe there are words truly ridiculous, and which never were other

This objection is refuted by experience. For the Greeke Church and the Romane had not in time paſt, nor ever had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tongue, and yet in the meane while ceaſed they not to celebrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themſelves Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills. There were choſen out of <hi>Italie</hi> Deputies, which underſtood the Greeke, for then the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Church complied with the Greeke; becauſe the Emperours reſided in Greece. By whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſent his Deputies to

But if for the holding of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills in the Weſt, it be neceſſarie that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue bee common every where. The Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and Colleges where the Latine are taught eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, ſuffice to preſerve the Latine tongue; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the publicke ſervice were in the vulgar.

It is a great fondneſſe to thinke that the barbarous Latine of the Maſſe ſerves unto the preſervation of the Latine tongue: or that the Text of the Maſſe ſerveth for the vnderſtanding of <hi>Virgill,</hi> or of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> or to ſpeake <hi>Tullies</hi> Latine, and to make one a Cicero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian. Nay in very deed were the Latine of the Maſſe as elegant as it is groſſe and barbarous, yet would it be but a very weake meanes to preſerve the Latine tongue, the Greeke of the Greeke Liturgie, which is pure, hath not hindred that the Greeke tongue was not then corrupted, when the

               <p>As for their founding of the Chriſtian faith upon the deciſion of Councills, which are found contrarie one to another, and the new contradicting the ancient: and of whom the Pope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth but what makes for himſelfe: oppoſing himſelfe often againſt generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills: It is another queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is not for this place. The cleare paſſages
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:11457:120"/> of Scripture and which have no need to be interpreted, are ſufficient unto ſalvation. Whoſoever writeth himſelfe for an infallible iudge of the ſenſe of the Scripture, ſets himſelfe above God. For he makes God ſpeake after his owne will, and may change the Scripture under colour of interpreting it: and hath the open way to build and erect an Empire.

               <p>Such as theſe are the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of our Adverſaries, which are but ſhifts, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſons and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without, yea againſt

By this change the Latine tongue in the publike ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was fully eſtabliſhed: for that which was but done formerly thorow the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Biſhops of France, from thenceforth was done by law, according as the ſervitude increaſed, from age to age. It would be now a crime of Hereſie, and a manifeſt rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:11457:135"/> the papall Sea, to goe about to have divine ſervice in any other tongue, then in the Latine or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. At this day one of the moſt eſſentiall Marks of the Romiſh Hierarchie, is the Romiſh language. And I wot not, whether it was by chance, or by conjecture, or by inſpiration, that <hi>Ireneus</hi> above fourteene hundred yeares agoe, in this word <hi>Latine,</hi> found out the name of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſix hundred ſixtie ſix.</p>
               <p>The like matters happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue became ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſo familiar, that in the times of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours <hi>Domitian</hi> and <hi>Trajan,</hi> and a long time after them,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:11457:135"/> the Latine tongue was there as familiar, as at <hi>Rome,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in <hi>Arragon,</hi> and in the <hi>Cantabrick</hi> Mountaines, which is the countrey of <hi>Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay</hi> and in <hi>Galicia.

Whereupon we need not wonder, if when the Chriſtian religion thither entred, the ordinarie ſervice was done in Latine, not for all that, after the forme, nor by the ordinance of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who indeed

               <p>In the yeare 596.

               <p>This <hi>Austin</hi> came to <hi>England</hi> with a traine of fortie perſons, and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe to one of the pettie kings named <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>received him with honour.

The Queene a while after drew in her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who was followed by a multitude of Pagans. Of this King the above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obtained permiſſion to communicate with the Chriſtians of the North-part of <hi>England,</hi> whom he exhorted to ioyne themſelves with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as faith <hi>Weſtmonaſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis) Sanctum Paſcha &amp; alia perplura vnitati Eccleſiae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contraria faciebant.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:11457:144"/> eſteemed a prudent man, and of holy life, and they asked him whether at <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines</hi> perſwaſion they ſhould part with their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtomes.

This was the cauſe, that they likewiſe

               <p>As for <hi>Germany,</hi> Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie came in thither very late. <hi>Radbod</hi> King of the Friſons in the yeare 700. of our Lord, was a Pagan: and <hi>Franconia</hi> began to receive the Goſpell. And the Saxons
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:11457:147"/> againſt whom <hi>Charlemagne</hi> made ſo great warres in the yeare 775. and following, were Pagans, and were ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Chriſtianitie by the ſword, as were alſo the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This Prelat doth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his accuſtomed manner, which is to proove a thing, which is not in controverſie, and ſo to wander from the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Hee ſaith, that the Latine tongue was not vulgar in <hi>Africa:</hi> but that is not the queſtion. Wee diſpute not here of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:11457:149"/> the vulgar tongue, but of a tongue underſtood by the people. It matters not whether the Latine was, or was not the vulgar tongue in <hi>Africa:</hi> the queſtion is whether it was there underſtood or no. In this part of <hi>Africa,</hi> which he noteth to us, the Liturgie was ſaid in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, becauſe the Latine tongue was there more common and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the people then the <hi>Punick</hi> tongue, which was their ancient vulgar tongue. It is already much that <hi>Du Perron</hi> yeeldeth us that the Latine tongue was the vulgar tongue of <hi>Carthage</hi> a Capitall towne of <hi>Africa.</hi> Hee confeſſeth alſo the like of the townes
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:11457:150"/> of <hi>Africa,</hi> which were Colonies. Now the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall towne of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey being Latine, where the Proconſuls Court was, and the officers of the Emperour, and where the cauſes were judged in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and wherein there were an innumerable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other townes being Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Colonies: and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out all theſe townes, they whom the Romanes called <hi>Curiales,</hi> &amp; the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whom in <hi>France</hi> we call <hi>les Gens du Roy,</hi> being La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, it is no wonder, if all the people thorow the maine Countrey were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſpeake Latine, and that the Latine tongue
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:11457:150"/> there was more uſuall then the Punick tongue, which was the vulgar tongue. Wherefore as at <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſo alſo at <hi>Bonne,</hi> and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther townes of <hi>Africa</hi> ſubject to the Romanes, not onely the Liturgie, but alſo their Sermons were made in Latine. In Latine it was that Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Aurelius,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> preached. The which <hi>Augustine</hi> being borne in the towne of <hi>Thagaſt</hi> or <hi>Tegeſt</hi> in <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> where the people were halfe barbarous, and farre from <hi>Carthage:</hi> yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe in the 1 of his Confeſſions, Chapter 14.<note place="margin">Latina didici ſine vllo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu atque cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatu, inter etiam blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimenta nu tricum, &amp; io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca arridenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> ſaith, hee had learned the Latine amongſt the blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments and flatteries of
